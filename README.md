Public repo which contains some basic configuration for some basic dot files.
Currently, the following environments are configured:
- bashrc
- zshrc
- vimrc
- kitty

The plugins for vimrc are managed by Vim Plugs. So, do run inside vim terminal `:PlugInstall` after the dotbot finishes its installation.
